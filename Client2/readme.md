This project exists to launch a second copy of the client in debug mode. To do this right click the project, click properties. In the debug section choose `Start External Program` rather than start project. Find the client exe that'll have been produced once you build the solution for the first time. It'll be somewhere like `OperationalTransform\Client\bin\Debug\Client.exe`.
